## Task One - Change an open-source Python Pac-Man implementation.

### Changing the Rules
* Will be called Vax-Man;
* Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it;
* Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man;
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds.

### Objective
* Collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
